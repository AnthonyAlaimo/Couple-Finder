## Description ##

Tired and alone? Introducing <insert name here>,
a brand new relationship finder web app for those who need just a little bit of help meeting new people.
Whether you're looking for a romantic partner or new best friend, you can be sure to find those who match what you're looking for.

## Beta Key Features ##

- Create and update your profile by filling in some information about yourself and what you are looking for.

- Upon creation of a new profile, the user will fill out a personality test that will help their initial match criteria and get a estimate of their overall personality type.

- Match with a wide variety of other users based on criteria such as age, gender, location, common hobbies, etc.

- Message those people that you match with in one on one conversations where no private information is exposed.

- Unmatch those people that you are not interested in and never see them again.

## Final Features ##

- Additional Filters: Filter by more comprehensive fields and hobbies.

- Ranked Filters: Designate which filters are more important to you than others and be matched accordingly.

- AI will refine matching criteria the more a user uses the app.

- Use the app on computer and mobile devices.

## Technologies ##

- Heroku Cloud Application Platform to host the web application

- Nodejs for the Server

- AngularJS for the Front End

- Postgres SQL for the Database
